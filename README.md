## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<!-- Any tools or versions of languages needed to run code. For example specific Python or Node versions. Minimum hardware requirements also go here. -->

`FIXME` requires Python 3.11.

### Installation

<!-- How to build or install the application. -->

We recommend installing in a project specific virtual environment created using
a environment management tool such as
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/). To install the latest
development version of `FIXME` using `pip` in the currently active
environment run

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/NSs-FLF-RHUL/FIXME.git
```

Alternatively create a local clone of the repository with

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NSs-FLF-RHUL/FIXME.git
```

and then install in editable mode by running

```sh
pip install -e .
```

### Running Locally

### Running Tests

<!-- How to run tests on your local system. -->

Tests can be run across all compatible Python versions in isolated environments
using [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) by running

```sh
tox
```

To run tests manually in a Python environment with `pytest` installed run

```sh
pytest tests
```

again from the root of the repository.

### Building Documentation

The MkDocs HTML documentation can be built locally by running

```sh
tox -e docs
```

from the root of the repository. The built documentation will be written to
`site`.

Alternatively to build and preview the documentation locally, in a Python
environment with the optional `docs` dependencies installed, run

```sh
mkdocs serve
```
